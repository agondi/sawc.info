                <p>Hi there, Bharat here. I'm a civil engineer working in the waste management industry. Originally from Hyderabad, India, I moved to the US for my masters degree. In my journey so far, I have had many friends and family mentor and guide me that shaped my life. It's exciting to be part of SAWC platform and do the same for someone else. I absolutely adore the manga/comic called One Piece (nothing beats that). I spend most of my free time reading about it and watching tollywood movies.</p>

                <p>As a young student who moved from Kargil during the Kargil War, for studies to Srinagar and then to Jammu and , finally Delhi for higher studies, I found resonances with classmates and peers who faced various experiences and emotions. I advocated for ground level changes through initiating We for Kargil, a non profit organisation aimed at empowering vulnerable sections of Kargil and acting as a grassroots level movement altering the discourse on Kargil from being synonymous with war to one representing its rich cultural heritage. I also shared my time at another organization, the Charkha Development Communication Network as a coordinator for Kargil, wherein I focused on reaching out to the far flung areas of Kargil district involving students for their projects. Furthermore, I am enrolled as a member of J&K Bar Council and registered with Kargil Bar Association to continue working for people who may not have much awareness regarding their own rights. </p>

I absolutely love to teach and joining SAWC has given me the unique opportunity to share the lessons I've learnt from all the mistakes I've made to help others improve personally, academically as well as professionally. Though even more so than teaching, I love to listen and learn and hopefully benefit from someone else's human experience. so I hope that this experience is as memorable for you as it will be for me! Also don't forget to remember that those who look outside; dream, and those who look inside; awaken. Jung's onto something there. </p>

                <p>Hello,  I'm Talha!  I'm a final year grad student in Tsinghua University Beijing studying Automotive Engineering,  hopefully going to graduate in 2021.  I joined SAWC because I benfitted a lot from a similar program back in high school personally and professionally. It is due to this that I feel I could mentor about everything I learnt till now and SAWC is among the best platforms for that. Besides that,  I'm an avid bodybuilding fan and love hiking and mountain climbing. </p>

                <p>My name is Abdelsalam Gena. I also go by the name Gosee (pronounced as Go-Say). I come from a place called Oromia, in Ethiopia (the biggest region in Ethiopia). I am currently a second year at Ashoka University and studying physics and math. I also love writing poems (I was even planning to minor in creative writing but had to change my mind because physics was too good along with math). Throughout the day, besides academics, I listen to hip-hop and appreciate the greatness of this form of poetry. I'm joining SAWC to learn how to lead the future. I do want to do something similar to what SAWC is doing. Hence, I am excited to learn (and teach).</p>

In all honesty, I would not say I'm a very regular book reader as in reading books all day EVERYDAY but I do enjoy reading books, gymming,outdoor sports eg basketball,soccer,cricket,throwball.I am extremely passionate about writing and my essays have been published in my schools Golden Pen Award edition twice and in the poetry book for exceptional poetries once.I am really excited to be interacting with new people in the mentorship programme and look forward to it!</p>

I joined SAWC because I am an alumni of Teach for India and Akanksha Foundation and I really believe in what the SAWC is trying to do. I come from an underprivileged background and had a lot of mentors growing up and I feel like I can relate to the young adults of South Asia. To be honest, I have been through issues in my life and I want to share it with my mentees and let them know that nothing is impossible if you ready to give your 100% in doing something. It doesn't have to be things related to academics, it can be giving your 100% in being a good human being and taking ethical decisions in your life. I also want to develop the habit of decision making in my mentees, advising and mentoring them and learning from them. Nevertheless, I am very grateful for this opportunity and looking forward to sharing my experiences with people and listening to their experiences.  I love talking, love playing badminton, love debates, rain, Chai, cooking (Indian Veg) and watching. </p>

                  <p>Hey, I'm Shizza! I am a graduate student at Stanford University and pursuing an MA in International Education Policy Analysis. Teaching and mentoring has been an important part of my life and I derive immense joy from helping others reach their potential. I have an undergraduate degree in structural engineering, and professional experiences in STEM research and education. I also have a background in social sciences and sociology of education. My personal interests include reading, painting and spending time with family. I am excited to be a part of SAWC and make meaningful connections with South Asian students. Through this opportunity, I hope to foster mutual growth and enrichment, helping students navigate the tricky terrains of personal, academic and professional development in the midst of a pandemic. </p>

                  <p>Hello! I am Shruti. I am a second year,  undergrad student of Sociology in Lady Shri Ram College. I applied for the mentorship programme because it provided me with the opportunity to partly undo the damage of an education system that has inculcated enough fear to be afraid of one’s own shadow. It is like telling your younger self “there is nothing to fear except fear in itself”. My life is constricted to the trinity of books, writing, and good rock music. I sleep in the morning and dream at night. I am not an owl. I am just a science experiment that went rogue.</p>

This summer, I had the opportunity to volunteer with an organisation called IEI to create radio literacy lessons for children living in remote valleys of Pakistan, facing the digital divide. Despite lockdown, this experience was a reminder of the endless ways I could still reach out to help people. Hence, SAWC presented me an amazing opportunity to help guide and support students during this time of uncertainty. I am excited to be part of SAWC and hope to make it an insightful and great learning experience for others too. If I am not working, you will find me either playing badminton or reading but lockdown has definitely added Netflix to the list!</p>

      <p>Hi everyone, I'm Muneef! I'm an undergraduate student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computational Finance. We're living in unprecedented times, and with that, comes a plethora of experiences that we all can learn from; and that makes SAWC all the more worthwhile. Based on my own experiences, I know how much I have benefitted from having mentors guiding me in every step of the way, be it professionally or academically. The transition from High School to University can be very demanding, and as a mentor, I sincerely hope that SAWC (and I, touchwood) can help you ease into the experience. I'd love to listen to your own unique stories, or maybe even go over who your favorite YouTuber or Sportsperson is. The possibilities are endless, I hope.</p>

      <p>Hello! I'm Payal, a third-year undergraduate student at Ashoka University. I am pursuing my major and minor in two subjects I absolutely love--Psychology and English literature, respectively--and hope to become a clinical psychologist someday. I joined SAWC because I have always loved the experience of teaching and mentoring other people in whatever capacity I can, and it gives me immense pleasure to be able to share knowledge with others. I really look forward to being a part of this program and getting to know some amazing people! In my free time, you will find either find me writing, watching Netflix, or dreaming about the day the world goes back to normal. </p>

      <p>Hi! My name is Aisha. I’m a recent university graduate where I studied government and international politics, along with data analysis and conflict resolution. I hope to pursue a career in public policy, working to find solutions to very real problems. My professional development was shaped by mentors who provided guidance and insight into opportunities I should pursue. I’m excited to bring that advice and personal experiences into the SAWC mentorship program. </p>
