[South Asian Winter Camp by Stanford students](https://www.sawc.info)

Design and Code by Amita Gondi

In many parts of South Asia, schools have been closed since February. Students are homebound, many of them yearning to return to school and incredibly uncertain about the future of their own education. The South Asian Winter Camp (SAWC) aims to tackle this uncertainty, loss of connection, and desire for intellectual stimulation through a two-week online educational programme for South Asian youth held during Winter Break 2020. The project aims to bring together college students and South Asian youth to explore their academic interests, discuss personal and professional goals, and create local and sustainable mentorship models between high-school and undergraduate students. 


For two weeks, college students (i.e. mentors) will take turns to teach classes on subjects of their choice, and build mentorship relationships, exposing students to new and important academic fields and topics while also providing a space to connect and collaborate during a time of educational disruption worldwide. Mentors will have flexibility in designing their own classes— from something as broad as the fundamentals of political philosophy to something as niche as the role of mother-tongue education in Pakistan’s language policy. Youth from all over the subcontinent will be able to sign up for SAWC. Classes will be hosted based on India Standard Time (GMT +5.30).
